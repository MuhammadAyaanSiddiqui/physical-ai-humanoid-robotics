# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Build AI-Powered Robots from Simulation to Reality

Welcome to the most comprehensive course on Physical AI and humanoid robotics. Over 13 weeks, you'll learn to build intelligent robots that perceive, reason, and act in the physical world.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this course, you'll have created:

- **ROS 2 robot systems** with sensors and actuators
- **Digital twin simulations** in Gazebo and Unity
- **Perception pipelines** using NVIDIA Isaac
- **Voice-controlled robots** with Vision-Language-Action models
- **Autonomous humanoid** capable of navigation, perception, and manipulation

## Course Philosophy

This course follows three core principles:

1. **Hands-On First**: Every concept is accompanied by runnable code
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Build from foundations to advanced systems
3. **Real-World Relevance**: Work with industry-standard tools (ROS 2, Isaac, Unitree robots)

## Who This Course Is For

### Prerequisites
- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Familiarity with Linux terminal
- High school mathematics (algebra, trigonometry)

### Target Audience
- **Students** exploring robotics and AI
- **Engineers** transitioning to Physical AI
- **Researchers** prototyping robot systems
- **Hobbyists** building autonomous projects

## Course Modules

### 2. ROS 2 Robot Control (Weeks 3-5)
Master the Robot Operating System for robot programming.

Coming soon...

### 3. Digital Twin Simulation (Weeks 6-7)
Build and test robots in Gazebo and Unity simulators.

Coming soon...

### 4. NVIDIA Isaac AI (Weeks 8-10)
Add perception and navigation with Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS.

Coming soon...

### 5. Voice-Controlled Robotics (Weeks 11-12)
Integrate speech recognition and LLM-based planning.

Coming soon...

### 6. Capstone Project (Week 13)
Build an end-to-end autonomous humanoid system.

Coming soon...

## Hardware Options

### Budget Option: Simulation-Only ($0-$500)
Perfect for learning the fundamentals without physical hardware.

### Mid-Range: Cloud + Edge ($500-$1,000)
Combine cloud simulation with Jetson Orin edge deployment.

### Full Setup: Physical Robot ($3,000-$8,000)
Complete hardware stack with Unitree Go2 or G1 humanoid.
